## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd buzz-sort
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python verify_installation.py
```

This will check:
- Python version compatibility
- All required dependencies
- Configuration file and API keys

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python file_janitor.py
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select Folder**: Click "Select Folder" and choose the directory you want to organize
2. **Scan Files**: The application automatically scans and categorizes files
3. **AI Analysis**: Files are analyzed using AI to create intelligent clusters
4. **Review Plan**: Review the proposed organization plan showing:
   - New folder structure
   - File moves and renames
   - Operation summary
5. **Execute Plan**: Click "Execute Plan" to apply the changes (with safety confirmation)

### Features in Detail

#### File Scanning
- Recursively scans all files and subdirectories
- Extracts metadata: name, size, dates, type
- Groups files by category (documents, images, videos, etc.)
- Handles permission errors gracefully

#### AI Analysis (Two-Pass System)
- **Pass 1**: Analyzes filenames to create logical clusters
- **Pass 2**: Deep content analysis for each cluster
  - Text extraction from documents
  - Image recognition for photos
  - Smart rename suggestions

#### Organization Planning
- Creates descriptive folder names based on content
- Suggests meaningful file renames (e.g., `IMG_1234.jpg` ‚Üí `beach_sunset_hawaii.jpg`)
- Handles naming conflicts automatically
- Shows complete plan before execution

#### Safe Execution
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview operations without making changes
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Mandatory warning before execution
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar
- **Error Handling**: Continues on errors, reports all issues
- **Operation Logging**: Complete log of all changes

## Configuration

### Switching AI Providers

To switch from Gemini to Claude, update `ai_config.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "claude",
  "gemini_api_key": "your_gemini_key",
  "claude_api_key": "YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

**Note**: Claude integration is currently a stub. Full implementation coming soon.

### Environment Variables

You can also configure the application using environment variables:

```bash
export AI_PROVIDER=gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Environment variables take precedence over `ai_config.json`.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_workflow.py
```

The test suite includes:
- File scanning functionality
- AI service integration
- Organization plan generation
- Plan execution (dry-run and actual)
- Error handling scenarios
- Logging system

## Logging

All operations are logged to `logs/file_janitor.log`:
- File scans and analysis
- AI API calls and responses
- File operations (moves, renames, folder creation)
- Errors and warnings

View logs to troubleshoot issues or audit changes.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

**Error**: "API authentication failed"
- Verify your API key is correct in `ai_config.json`
- Check that the key has proper permissions
- Ensure you're using the correct provider setting

### Permission Errors

**Error**: "Permission denied"
- Run the application with appropriate permissions
- Check folder and file permissions
- On Windows, try running as Administrator if needed

### Network Issues

**Error**: "Network error" or "Connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify firewall settings allow Python to access the internet
- Try again if API service is temporarily unavailable

### API Quota Exceeded

**Error**: "API quota exceeded"
- Check your API usage limits
- Wait for quota reset (usually daily)
- Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with a small folder first to understand the workflow
2. **Review Plans**: Always review the organization plan before executing
3. **Backup Important Files**: Make backups before organizing critical directories
4. **Check Logs**: Review logs after execution to verify all operations
5. **Use Dry-Run**: Test with dry-run mode first for large operations

## Limitations

- **API Costs**: AI analysis requires API calls (check provider pricing)
- **File Types**: Some file types may not support deep content analysis
- **Large Directories**: Very large directories (1000+ files) may take time to process
- **Network Required**: Requires internet connection for AI features

## Future Enhancements

- Full Claude AI integration
- Batch processing for very large directories
- Custom organization rules and templates
- Undo functionality
- Support for more file types (PDFs, Office documents)
- Local AI models for offline operation
