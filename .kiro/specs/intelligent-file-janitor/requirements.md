# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent File Janitor is an AI-powered desktop application that automatically organizes cluttered directories by analyzing file content and metadata. The system uses a two-pass AI triage approach to efficiently handle large volumes of files, providing intelligent organization suggestions through multimodal content analysis and executing user-approved reorganization plans.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: File System Analysis

**User Story:** As a user with a cluttered directory, I want the system to scan and analyze all files in my selected folder, so that I can understand what content needs to be organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a directory THEN the system SHALL scan all files and subdirectories recursively
2. WHEN scanning files THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including filename, file extension, modification date, creation date, and file size
3. WHEN the scan is complete THEN the system SHALL display the total number of files found and their basic categorization by file type
4. IF a file cannot be accessed due to permissions THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue scanning other files

### Requirement 2: Two-Pass AI Triage System

**User Story:** As a user with thousands of files, I want the system to efficiently process large volumes of files without overwhelming the AI analysis, so that I can get results in a reasonable timeframe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL implement a two-pass analysis approach
2. WHEN executing Pass 1 THEN the system SHALL analyze only filenames and group files into logical clusters (e.g., "Project Documents," "Vacation Photos," "Tax Forms")
3. WHEN Pass 1 is complete THEN the system SHALL present cluster summaries with file counts to the user
4. WHEN executing Pass 2 THEN the system SHALL perform detailed content analysis on each cluster individually
5. IF a cluster contains more than 100 files THEN the system SHALL further subdivide it before deep analysis

### Requirement 3: Multimodal Content Analysis

**User Story:** As a user with diverse file types, I want the system to understand the actual content of my files beyond just filenames, so that it can make intelligent organization decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing text files (.pdf, .docx, .txt) THEN the system SHALL extract and analyze a preview of the text content to determine the file's purpose
2. WHEN analyzing image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp) THEN the system SHALL use AI vision capabilities to understand the image contents
3. WHEN analyzing video files THEN the system SHALL extract metadata and thumbnail for basic categorization
4. WHEN content analysis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to filename and metadata analysis
5. IF a file type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL categorize it based on extension and metadata only

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Organization Plan Generation

**User Story:** As a user wanting to organize my files, I want the system to create a detailed action plan for reorganizing my directory, so that I can review and approve the changes before they are made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive organization plan
2. WHEN creating the plan THEN the system SHALL specify new folder structures with logical, descriptive names
3. WHEN planning file operations THEN the system SHALL include renaming suggestions for files with generic names (e.g., IMG_1234.jpg â†’ Beach_sunset_hawaii.jpg)
4. WHEN generating the plan THEN the system SHALL specify the destination folder for each file move operation
5. WHEN the plan is ready THEN the system SHALL present it in a clear, reviewable format before any execution

### Requirement 5: Plan Execution System

**User Story:** As a user who has approved an organization plan, I want the system to safely execute the file operations, so that my directory becomes organized according to the AI's recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user approves a plan THEN the system SHALL execute file operations using system commands
2. WHEN executing operations THEN the system SHALL create new directories as specified in the plan
3. WHEN moving files THEN the system SHALL rename files according to the plan before moving them
4. WHEN an operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining operations
5. WHEN execution is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful and failed operations

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Controls

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive interface to control the file organization process, so that I can easily select folders, review plans, and execute operations safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL provide a folder selection button for browsing directories
2. WHEN a folder is selected THEN the system SHALL analyze file dates and suggest intelligent time-based filtering options
3. WHEN displaying suggestions THEN the system SHALL show options like "Organize recent files (50 files)" or "Tackle May 2024 cluster (150 files)"
4. WHEN an organization plan is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in a clear, read-only review area
5. WHEN the user clicks "Execute Plan" THEN the system SHALL show a mandatory safety confirmation dialog warning about irreversible file modifications

### Requirement 7: Safety and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user concerned about file safety, I want the system to provide clear warnings and handle errors gracefully, so that I don't accidentally lose or corrupt my files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user attempts to execute a plan THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation with a warning about irreversible changes
2. WHEN file operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information without stopping the entire process
3. WHEN duplicate filenames would be created THEN the system SHALL automatically append numbers to ensure uniqueness
4. IF the target directory lacks write permissions THEN the system SHALL notify the user and request permission elevation
5. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed log of all changes made for user reference
